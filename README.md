## Base

### Description

The first assignment is to create the caster base.  The base's dimensions are 200 mm x 120 mm and 8 mm thick.  It has 6 holes 10 mm wide and 20 mm from the edge equally spaced along the edges.

### Reflection

This was my first Onshape part and [following along with Dr. Shields made it super easy.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93BFUD-HAG8&feature=emb_title&scrlybrkr=5670f0b4)  I learned about 
* sketching (shortcut **shift-s**)
* constructions lines (shortcut **Q**)
* dimensions (shortcut **D**)
* extruding both add and remove (shortcut key **E**)
* linear patterns (no shortcut)

Onshape is awesome.  I found it really helpful to rename all my sketches.  It is going to be a GREAT year in engineering.

## Mount

### Description

This is my second onshape part and [following along with Matthew Shields made it easy and understandable.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWDk4BZFXDQ&feature=emb_logo)

### Reflection

Onshape is still a bit difficult for me to understand at times but I will get a hang of it at some point.

## Fork

### Description

Third onshape part [following Mr.Shields once again made it easy and understandable.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQlTfOw8rYQ&feature=emb_logo)

### Evidence

[The fork in onshape](https://cvilleschools.onshape.com/documents/8db6d13588cb8e64d068619d/w/6e1fea930b09f1dbb236a367/e/6b4733595dfd30a0f345e626)

### Reflection

Little by little as time passes I'm understanding onshape and how to make certain parts more easier. I know what keys i need to use when to measure and how to sketch and extrude.

## Tire

### Reflection

When doing the tire, it was a lot easier than I thought it would be, I'm proud of myself.
